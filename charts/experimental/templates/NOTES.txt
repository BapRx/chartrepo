Thank you for installing the {{ .Chart.Name }} Authelia Chart.

The helm release name is {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if (include "authelia.ingress" .) }}
You have selected to use a regular ingress. 

You should be able to access Authelia soon via https://{{ include "authelia.ingressHostWithPath" . }} if everything is configured correctly in your values and the DNS record points to the correct location.
{{- else -}}
    {{- if (include "authelia.ingressTraefik" .) }}
You have selected the Traefik CRD to deploy the ingress. You can apply the {{ default (printf "%s-auth" (include "authelia.name" .)) .Values.ingress.traefikCRD.authMiddlewareNameOverride }} middleware to any Traefik ingress type in order to use Authelia auth with that ingress.

You should be able to access Authelia soon via https://{{ include "authelia.ingressHostWithPath" . }} if everything is configured correctly in your values and the DNS record points to the correct location.
    {{- else -}}
You have not installed an ingress which you can do manually by specifying {{ printf "http://%s:%s" (include "authelia.name" .) (default "80" .Values.service.port) }} as the endpoint.
